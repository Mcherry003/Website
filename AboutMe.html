            <center>My name is Mason Cherry, i'm 16 and this is my website to tell you about myslef and what I do. I am currently enrolled at DACC for app development. I have recently built my pc and have gotten into pc gameing and streaming. But thats a bit later lets start from the beginning</center>
            <center>I was born on November 24th, 2004. I was very little when I got into sports. I was about 5 when I started playing baseball. I played with my brother when his team needed an extra player. I would make my fist play in the outfeild with a plastic glove.</center>
            <center>Another one of my famous plays that goes around my family is one that I will never forget. I was on third base and the ball was hit and I was running home and I slid a bit too soon and I had to scoot my way to home plate. I didn't think about it at all until I got older and my family</center>
            <center>keeps bringing it up. It's embarrassing but its fun to joke about it at home. I will continue to love and play baseball because it was fun and my team and I would make it to many tournaments and win. We had a tournament in finley OH and I went to bunt so we could get a run in but I</center>
            <center>ended up breaking my hand. I was so scared I made my parents drive me all the way back to delaware to go to the hospital.</center>
