            <center>I started to stream on Twitch on my ps4 around 2018 school has made it hard to consistantly stream but I do when I can. I play a veriaty of games but mostly fps games.</center>
            <center>For Example, I play/Stream Rainbow Six Seige, Fortnite, Valorant, Minecraft, Rocket Leauge, and many others. Right now I am playing a lot of Valorant and Minecraft. My friends and I play together mosty but sometimes</center>
            <center>I play alone or with some online friends. I like to stream on twithc because it helps me talk to people all around and get to know a lot of people and hopefully someday make my own community.</center>
